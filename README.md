# White-Password  
A simple approach to Secure Password Input in python.  

## Why white-password?  
No-human in this world wish to get their Passwords to get leaked out.
Python script that you write will **not** know that you're entering a **password** until and unless you use **_[white-password]()_** which hides
the user input in a much more secure way.
No-one will ever know how long your password is either as you see an empty line with a blank space.
